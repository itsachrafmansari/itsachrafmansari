<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Been near computers since childhood, still learning about them and willing to become a software engineer in the near future (Inshallah) after graduating with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the local faculty in my hometown Khouribga, where Iâ€™m currently living and spending most of my time either studying, doing some 3D modeling and interior design or learning about AI and Machine Learning.</p>
